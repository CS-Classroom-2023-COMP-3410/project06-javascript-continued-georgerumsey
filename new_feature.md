I attempted to add a flip-clock animation to the digital clock, where the numbers would flip realistically like an old-school mechanical clock. This is a reasonable frontend feature because it can be implemented using CSS animations, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation, and many websites use similar effects for clocks and countdown timers. The animation was supposed to trigger each time the seconds changed, with a smooth transition that followed realistic physics. While I was able to get the animation kind of close to working, the biggest issue was that adding new features kept breaking existing onesâ€”for example, the alarm stopped working when I adjusted the flip animation, and changing the font size interfered with the animation timing. Debugging became increasingly difficult as each fix introduced unexpected side effects elsewhere in the code, making it hard to maintain a fully functional clock.
